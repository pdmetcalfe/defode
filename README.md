defode is a convenient way to generate ordinary differential equations
as used by the standard VODE solver.  The equations are declared in
Python code that then generates compilable C code that can be used
normally.

The supported mathematical operations can be easily extended, and
there is also a convenience layer that simplifies compartmental
modelling.
